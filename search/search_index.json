An API is simply a way for one system to communicate with another. Our API for example, lets other computers, websites, or applications to send SMS messages. Using an API is a lot like using a web browser, except you need to send some additional information alongside the URL. Our API is a RESTful API, which means that it uses a standard set of HTTP methods to communicate with other systems. How do you use an API? To use an API you need to read the documentation, which outlines what the API does, and how to use it. Our API documentation can be found here: https://smsjet.net/docs The great thing about SMSjet's documentation is that it is fully interactive meaning you don't need to download any API testing software to test things out! Advanced API User? If you are experienced with using APIs then reading through and interacting with /docs is a great way to get started. Sending your first SMS Warning SMSjet does its best to figure out phone number formatting, but you must include the country code before any phone number you want to SMS. See Phone Number Formatting for more information. Send SMS via SMSjet.net/docs Our documentation is a living and breathing documentation, which means that it is constantly updated with new features and improvements. Below are some getting started tips for sending SMS with Python, Javascript, curl. Your account page Send SMS via Command Line cURL is a popular command line utility for interacting with APIs. If you have a Linux, MacOS, or Windows system, you can use the cURL command to send SMS: curl -X 'POST' \\ 'https://smsjet.net/api/send' \\ -H 'accept: application/json' \\ -H 'apikey: testkey' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"message\": \"Hello World\", \"phone_number\": \"+61412345678\" }' We also plan to release a commandline tool for sending SMS in the future. Contact us if you are interested in testing out SMSjet's command line tool . Send SMS via Python We're big fans of Python here at SMSjet, so we're in the process of writing a pip module and commandline tool for sending SMS. In the meantime, you can still make use of the requests library. Python Requests Library import requests import json response = requests . post ( 'https://smsjet.net/api/send' , headers = { 'accept' : 'application/json' , 'apikey' : 'yourapikey' , 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' }, data = json . dumps ({ 'message' : 'Hello World' , 'phone_number' : '+61412345678' }) ) Warning If using requests, make sure you use the right method for the API endpoint you are targetting (eg. requests.post() for /api/send and requests.get() for /api/validate ). Send SMS via Javascript Coming Soon... We're still building out the Javascript snippets.

We have CRUD API endpoints for Contact Groups, which you can explore here . Tip You can also create a contact group by uploading an Excel or CSV file here . We highly reccomend using the templates provided for uploading your contacts. When should you use Contact Groups? If you have a group of phone numbers that doesn't change often, Contact Groups can be a useful way of reaching them. Warning One issue with contact groups is that they can fall out of sync with your phone number list. For example, if you add a new phone number to your phone number list, you won't see it in your Contact Group until you add it. Example Scenario: You have a small team with 12 people who you want to be alerted when an incident occurs, you can use Contact Groups to send SMS to all of them. Updating Contact Groups One way to avert the issue with Contact Groups falling out of sync with your list of phone numbers is to update your entire Contact Group with a PUT request before making a new SMS request. Api Method: PUT Endpoint: /api/contactgroups/[contact-group-id] Docs: Contact Groups Documentation Removing/Adding a Phone Number to a Contact Group Some APIs use PATCH instead of PUT . PUT requests replace the entire object, while PATCH requests only update the fields that are specified. We use PUT requests for Contact Groups, so you can easily and efficiently update the entire Contact Group with your local list of phone numbers. Tip To add a phone number, you can request the list from the server using a GET request, and then add the phone number to the list, and send it back to the API with the PUT request. Deleting a phone number works similiarly, you can request the list from the server using a GET request, and then remove the phone number from the list, and send it back to the API with the PUT request.","title":"Contact Groups"},{"location":"user-guide/5.%20Contact%20Groups/#contact-groups","text":"Contact Groups are a way of storing a list of phone numbers that you want to send SMS to.
