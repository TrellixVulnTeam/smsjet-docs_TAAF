# Phone Number Formatting

Phone numbers come in a few different formats depending upon where the recipient is. We send SMS from Australia, so we require that every phone number be in the following format:

`[PLUS SIGN: "+"]` + `[COUNRTY CODE: "61"]` + `[PHONE NUMBER: "12345678"]` = `+612345678`

Below are some examples of valid and invalid phone numbers for SMSjet's API:


| Phone     		| Valid 				| Explanation            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `+61488000111` 	|   :material-check-all: 	| Includes country code and leading plus  |
| `+61 4 88 000 111` 	|   :material-check: 	| Whitespace is ok  |
| `61488000111` 	|   :material-check:	| You can exclude the leading plus (we'll add it back in) |
| `0488000111`    		| :material-close:  	|  Missing country code prefix |


!!! tip "Tip: Use E.164 Format"
    SMSjet will always try to get your phone number in the E.164 format, if it's already in the E.164 format, you don't have to worry about running into any validation issues.
