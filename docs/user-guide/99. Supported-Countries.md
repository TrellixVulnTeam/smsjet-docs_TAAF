This sample of countries includes ~ 4 billion people. If a phone number isn't within this geographic region, then we will be unable to send SMS (the API will return a HTTP Status 400).

If you require a region to be added to the list, [please contact us](https://smsjet.net/contact). We may be able to add it in the future, or if you are a commercial customer we can work with you to add it.
