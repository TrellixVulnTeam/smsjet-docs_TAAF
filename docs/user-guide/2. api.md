# Sending SMS with the API

## What is an API?

* An API is simply a way for one system to communicate with another. Our API for example, lets other computers, websites, or applications to send SMS messages. 

* Using an API is a lot like using a web browser, except you need to send some additional information alongside the URL.

* Our API is a RESTful API, which means that it uses a standard set of HTTP methods to communicate with other systems. 

## How do you use an API?

To use an API you need to read the documentation, which outlines what the API does, and how to use it. 

Our API documentation can be found here: [https://smsjet.net/docs](https://smsjet.net/docs)

The great thing about SMSjet's documentation is that it is **fully interactive** meaning you don't need to download any API testing software to test things out! 

!!! tip "Advanced API User?"
    If you are experienced with using APIs then reading through and interacting with [/docs](https://smsjet.net/docs) is a great way to get started. 

## Sending your first SMS

!!! warning
    SMSjet does its best to figure out phone number formatting, but you **must include the country code** before any phone number you want to SMS. See [Phone Number Formatting](3. phone-formatting.md) for more information.

### Send SMS via SMSjet.net/docs

Our documentation is a living and breathing documentation, which means that it is constantly updated with new features and improvements. Below are some getting started tips for sending SMS with Python, Javascript, curl.

### Send SMS via Command Line 

cURL is a popular command line utility for interacting with APIs. If you have a Linux, MacOS, or Windows system, you can use the [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) command to send SMS:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://smsjet.net/api/send' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'apikey: testkey' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "message": "Hello World",
  "phone_number": "+61412345678"
}'
```

We also plan to release a commandline tool for sending SMS in the future. [Contact us if you are interested in testing out SMSjet's command line tool](https://smsjet.net/contact).

### Send SMS via Python

We're big fans of Python here at SMSjet, so we're in the process of writing a pip module and commandline tool for sending SMS. In the meantime, you can still make use of the `requests` library.

#### Python Requests Library

``` py
import requests
import json

response = requests.post(
	'https://smsjet.net/api/send',
	headers = {
		'accept': 'application/json',
		'apikey': 'yourapikey',
		'Content-Type': 'application/json'
	},
	data = json.dumps({
		'message': 'Hello World',
		'phone_number': '+61412345678'
	})
)

```

!!! warning
	If using requests, make sure you use the right method for the API endpoint you are targetting (eg. `requests.post()` for `/api/send` and `requests.get()` for `/api/validate`).

### Send SMS via Javascript

!!! building "Coming Soon..."
    We're still building out the Javascript snippets. In the meantime, you can use [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) or [Jquery AJAX](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) to make POST, GET, UPDATE, DELETE requests to the API.
