# Two Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two factor authentication is a great way to secure your service, and SMS is the easiest way to implement 2FA, since almost everyone has a mobile.

## Two Factor Code Generation: `code`

A simple 2FA implementation is to send a code to a phone number, and the user must enter the code to login. To keep things simple and secure, you will generate the verification code on your end, and we'll simply pass it on to the user. 

## Identitying Yourself: `sender_identity`

We use the `sender_identity` to identify the application that is sending the SMS. This is very useful for users and also for mobile operating systems (iOS) which can autofill the for the user when it's received. 

Your `sender_identity` should be your app or website's name. 

## Message Format

If you'd like to send a custom 2FA message, you can do so by using the [`/api/send`](http://100.95.56.78:8000/docs#/Sending%20SMS/send_sms_api_send_post) endpoint. Otherwise we will format your message in the following way:


	Your [sender_identity] verification code is: [code]
