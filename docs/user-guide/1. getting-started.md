    Rememeber to **verify your email** address before you start using your account. If you need to resend your verification email, login to the dashboard and click **Resend Verification Email**.

### API Key

Your API key is your golden ticket to using SMSjet, it is required for almost all API calls. Think of it like your username and password combined. It's very important to **keep your API key secure**, since anyone who has access to it can send SMS on your behalf, view past SMS sent, and use your credits. So keep it safe.

To get your API key, login and go to ["Account"](https://smsjet.net/account). You'll see something similiar to the following:

!!! tip "Generate a new API Key"
    If you ever need to **generate a new API key**, go to the [accounts page](https://smsjet.net/account), and click "*Generate New API Key*". Your old API key will be invalidated, and you'll be given a new one. This is useful if you think your API key is compromised, or simply as a security practice.
